  Demo - Supercharging Development with AI
</h2>

## Description

This project demonstrates how AI tools like ChatGPT-4o and GitHub Copilot can accelerate software development, testing, and deployment for software engineers. The focus is on building the product API of an e-commerce application. All components—including controllers, API endpoints, services, entities, modules, and tests—were generated with the assistance of AI. Through this project, I aim to showcase the practical benefits of integrating AI into the development workflow to boost productivity and streamline the engineering process.
